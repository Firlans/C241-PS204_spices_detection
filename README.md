## About The Project
Indonesia's rempah-rempah (spices) are the fragrant foundation of its world-renowned cuisine. As of May 2024, the nation's spice exports have reached a remarkable US$1.4 billion, a significant 12.5% increase compared to the previous year. This fragrant journey through time showcases Indonesia's enduring role as a key player in the global spice trade.Yet, identifying these spices can be a challenge due to their similar appearances. This confusion can limit exploration and appreciation of this rich culinary heritage.

Current methods of identifying rempah-rempah often rely on visual inspection, leading to misidentification and missed culinary opportunities. Inaccurate spice use can result in unintended flavors or even health risks.We propose a mobile app that leverages machine learning for object detection. Users simply point their smartphone camera at an unknown spice, and the app reveals its identity.  Following identification, the app unlocks a treasure trove of information, including origin, properties, health benefits, and traditional Indonesian culinary uses. To further inspire exploration, the app offers curated recipes featuring the identified spice.
